Hello World!

Maria here! I am new to the coding word, but got started beacuse I am studying computer programming! Would love to collaborate and get to know my fellow coders. I am from Mexico and so obviously my favorite food is Mexican, specifically tacos (who doesn't love tacos!!), although tacos in Mexico are much better than here.
